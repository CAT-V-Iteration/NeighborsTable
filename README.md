# Neighbor's Table
<img src='/public/assets/demo.gif'>

## Overview
Neighbor's Table is an open source and free to use tool for local farmers market vendors to meet local buyers looking for their produce. The idea stemmed from the difficulty faced by vendors as farmers markets shut down nationwide. Neighbor's Table supports local businesses and consumers.

## Our Goal:
We aim to deploy this product with the hopes to actually gain traction and help support our local communities!

We currently support the registration of buyers, vendors, and displaying products registered with specific vendors. Only vendors are able to add items, vendors can also use the same account for purchases, and we have revamped our UI! More features to come!


## Test on Local Machines

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

**Note:** Node.js is a requirement to run
